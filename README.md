# Real-Time-Hand-Gesture-Recognition

The project aims to implement static hand gesture recognition using image processing techniques. 
I used Mediapipe library in Python to detect and track hand landmarks in real-time video streams from a webcam. 

The output of the project is visualized in real-time using OpenCV. You can find the output of the project in the video provided in this repository.
